# MemEater v2  

MemEater is a lightweight, portable utility for stress-testing Windows memory handling.  
It is designed to intentionally overload system memory, allowing users and developers to observe how Windows behaves under low-memory conditions.

## Features

- **Portable and Lightweight:** No installation or dependencies requiredâ€”just run the executable.
- **Built with Visual Basic 6:** 100% native, no .NET or runtime requirements.
- **Custom Memory Load:** 
  - Consume all available memory in one click.
  - Consume memory in 1GB increments.
  - Instantly release all consumed memory.
- **Real-Time Stats:** 
  - Displays physical RAM and committed memory usage.
  - Shows number of active memory-consuming child processes.
- **Safe to Use:** All memory can be released with a single click.

## Intended Use

MemEater is intended for:
- Developers and IT professionals who need to test how their applications or systems behave under memory pressure.
- Stress-testing Windows memory management, paging, and stability.
- Educational purposes and controlled experiments.

**Warning:** Running MemEater will intentionally make your system unstable or unresponsive by consuming large amounts of memory.  
Use with caution and save your work before starting any test.
